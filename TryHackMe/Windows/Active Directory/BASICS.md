## Windows Domains

**<u>Windows Domain</u>**  is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralize the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository, which is called **<u>Active Directory</u>**

The server that runs _Active Directory_ services is called **<u>Domain Controller</u>** (DC).

Advantages of having a configured Windows Domain are:

- **Centralization**: every component, computer, or user can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.
- **Managing Security Policies**: security policies can be managed directly from Active Directory and later applied to all the users across the network as needed.

Amongst the ==many objects supported by AD, we have users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many others.==
