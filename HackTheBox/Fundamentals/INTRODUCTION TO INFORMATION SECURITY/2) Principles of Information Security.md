# **Fundamental InfoSec Principles**  
These principles form the foundation for managing, protecting, and securely handling sensitive data. They guide security policies, control measures, and best practices.  

## **Core Principles**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Confidentiality**  
> Ensures that only authorized individuals can access information.  
- Protects against unauthorized disclosure  
- Implemented via encryption, access controls  
### ðŸ”¹ **Integrity**  
> Ensures data remains accurate and complete.  
- Prevents unauthorized modification  
- Implemented via hashing, digital signatures  
### ðŸ”¹ **Availability**  
> Ensures authorized users can access information when needed.  
- Prevents disruptions in access  
- Implemented via redundancy, disaster recovery  
### ðŸ”¹ **Non-repudiation**  
> - Ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated
- Important for legal and e-commerce contexts  
- Implemented through measures like digital signatures and audit logs  
### ðŸ”¹ **Authentication**  
> Verifies identity before granting access.  
- Ensures only authorized users access resources  
- Implemented via passwords, biometrics, MFA  
### ðŸ”¹ **Privacy**  
> Ensures responsible handling of personal data.  
- Complies with data protection regulations  
- Implemented via data minimization, consent management

# **Information Security Processes**  
InfoSec processes protect data and systems from unauthorized access, misuse, and disruption. These processes ensure the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is maintained.  

## **Key InfoSec Processes**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Risk Assessment**  
> Identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities.  
- Evaluates security risks and impacts  
- Helps prioritize security efforts  

### ðŸ”¹ **Security Planning**  
> Develops strategies to mitigate risks.  
- Creates policies and procedures  
- Allocates resources for security initiatives  

### ðŸ”¹ **Implementation of Security Controls**  
> Puts security plans into action.  
- Deploys technical solutions and policies  
- Includes preventive and detective controls  

### ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring and Detection**  
> Continuously watches for security threats.  
- Uses SIEM systems, IDS/IPS  
- Identifies incidents quickly  

### ðŸ”¹ **Incident Response**  
> Reacts to detected security incidents.  
- Contains, mitigates, and recovers from threats  
- Follows established response procedures  

### ðŸ”¹ **Disaster Recovery**  
> Restores systems and data after incidents.  
- Implements backup and redundancy  
- Minimizes downtime and data loss  

### ðŸ”¹ **Continuous Improvement**  
> Adapts to evolving threats.  
- Updates security measures regularly  
- Conducts audits and security assessments
