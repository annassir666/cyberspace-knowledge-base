# What is Threat Intelligence?

`Threat Intelligence` is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organizations, industries, sectors or governments.

To mitigate against risks, we can start by trying to answer a few simple questions:

- Who's attacking you?
- What's their motivation?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out for?
## Threat Intelligence Classifications:

Threat Intelligence helps you understand how attackers relate to your systems and environment. It can be broken down into these main types:

- **Strategic Intel:** It helps leaders understand what kinds of threats are out there (like cybercrime trends) and how those could affect the whole business.

- **Technical Intel:** - _Technical info_ about how attacks happen — like malicious files, IP addresses, or tools hackers use. It's used by security teams to spot and stop threats.

- **Tactical Intel:** This looks at _how attackers work_ — their methods, techniques, and habits, TTPs. It helps security teams improve systems and block similar attacks in the future.

- **Operational Intel:** This focuses on _what the attacker wants_ and _who they’re targeting_. It helps protect the most important parts of the company — like key people, data, or systems. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.

# Tools

[**Urlscan.io**](https://urlscan.io/) is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions.

When a URL is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the web page, technologies utilized and other metadata about the website.


[Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) is a research project hosted by the Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are: 

- **Malware Bazaar** – A place where people can share samples of malware (bad software).
- **Feodo Tracker** – Tracks systems used by criminals to control malware like Emotet, Dridex, and TrickBot.
- **SSL Blacklist** – Keeps a list of suspicious security certificates and digital fingerprints used by bad websites.
- **URL Haus** – Shares links to websites that spread malware.
- **Threat Fox** – Shares warning signs (called IOCs) that show if a system might be infected or attacked.


[PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/) seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.


IT and Cybersecurity companies collect massive amounts of information that could be used for threat analysis and intelligence. Being one of those companies, Cisco assembled a large team of security practitioners called Cisco Talos to provide actionable intelligence, visibility on indicators, and protection against emerging threats through data collected from their products. The solution is accessible as [Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com/).
